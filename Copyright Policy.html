            <p>WowKit respects the intellectual property of others and expects its users to do the same. Each user must
                ensure that the materials they upload do not infringe any third-party copyright. </p>

            <h2>Copyright Violation Notification Process</h2>

            <p>If a person believes that his or her (its) copyright-protected work was posted on WowKit's site or app,
                or otherwise hosted by WowKit, without authorization, he or she may submit a copyright infringement
                notification.</p>

            <h3>The notification must include the following information:</h3>

            <p>
                1. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if any).<br>
                2. A clear and complete description of the work that you believe has been infringed. <br>
                3. The screenshot or other identifying location of the allegedly infringing work.<br>
                4. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted work is not authorized
                by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.<br>
                5. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying
                party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.<br>
                6. Your electronic or physical signature.<br><br>

                Submit the above information to us:<br>
                By Email :    <a href="mailto:support@wowkit.io">support@wowkit.io</a><br>
                All information submitted in the copyright infringement notification (including your name, address,
                phone and email address) may be forwarded to who posted the allegedly infringing work in question.
            </p>

            <h2>Counter-Notification Process</h2>

            <p>If WowKit receives a valid notification of alleged copyright infringement, WowKit will take reasonable
                steps to contact the User who uploaded to WowKit the relevant allegedly infringing material; and the
                User may then submit a valid counter-notification in relation to the Notification. During the process,
                WowKit would remove the infringing work or disable access to the work in question until the dispute is
                resolved.</p>

            <h3>A counter-notification must include the following information of the User:</h3>

            <p>
                1. The contact information, including full legal name, an email address, a physical address, and a phone
                number. <br>
                2. Identify the location, including any URL, of the work that has been removed or disabled.<br>
                3. Preliminary proof for not constituting infringement, including certificate of right, including but
                not limited to copyright certificate issued by authorized institution, materials showing the publication
                date of your copyrighted work, etc.<br>
                4. Your electronic or physical signature.<br><br>

                Submit the above information to us:<br>
                By Email :    <a href="mailto:support@wowkit.io">support@wowkit.io</a><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The counter-notification process may take up to 10 business days to complete, so please be patient.
                During this time, the copyright claimant may file an action seeking a court order to keep the content
                down. Please note that WowKit will forward the entire counter notice to the copyright claimant,
                including any personal information the User provides and the counter-notification may be made public.
                The claimant may use this information to file a lawsuit against the User.
            </p>

            <h2>Note</h2>

            <p>In filing any request, please ensure that your notice is complete and that your statements are accurate.
                If we request additional information necessary to make your notice complete, please provide that
                information promptly. If you fail to provide the required information, your request may not be processed
                further.
                Either the copyright claimant or the alleged infringer, please think twice before submitting a copyright
                infringement notification or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you are the actual
                rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holderâ€™s behalf. There are legal and financial
                consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual rights
                holder, or that you have a good faith belief that the work was removed in error, and that you understand
                the repercussions of submitting a false claim.
            </p>

            <h2>Repeated Infringement</h2>

            <p>Any User content which infringes intellectual property of any third party would be deleted. Your account may be suspended or terminated as a result of violation of multiple infringement or other breaching of terms of service and any community guideline issued by WowKit from time to time.</p>

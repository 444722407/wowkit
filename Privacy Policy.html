        <div class="content">

            <p>When you use our services, you're entrusting us with your information, and we understand this is a big
                responsibility. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand what information we
                collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and what choices you have. If you have any questions, you can
                always email us at
                <a href="mailto:support@wowkit.io">support@wowkit.io</a>
            </p>

            <h2>Information we collect</h2>

            <p><br><strong>1) Information you share with us or give us permission to obtain<br> Account Information.</strong><br>
                If you choose to sign-up using a third-party account (e.g., Apple, Google), you authorize us to obtain
                account information from the third-party platform.
                <br><br><strong>User generated contents.</strong><br>
                Such as texts, pictures, and other materials that you upload, distribute or stream on the App when you use WowKit Services.
                <br><br><strong>Other Information You May Submit.</strong><br>
                You may submit data to us for limited purposes such as requesting customer support; participating in a study or survey; entering contests or sweepstakes.
            </p>

            <p><br><strong>2) Information that is processed automatically</strong><br>
                When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behaviour may be processed
                automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct
                association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We process this
                information on the ground of our legitimate interest in improving our App and giving our users the best
                experience. If we do not access such data we may not be able to provide you with all the features of the
                App.<br>
                <br><strong>Log file information.</strong><br> 
                Log file information is automatically reported each time you make
                a request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you
                use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including time and date
                when you start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.
                <br><br><strong>Cookies and similar technologies. </strong><br> 
                When you use the App, cookies and similar
                technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small
                amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then
                sent back to the server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively.
                For example, we will know how many users access a specific areas or features within our App and which
                links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App
                is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you.
                <br><br><strong>Device data.</strong><br> 
                We collect and combine data about the devices you use to access WowKit,
                and data about your device usage and activity.
                <br><br><strong>Ad-related information.</strong><br>
                 The following data might be reported about the ads you can
                view: the date and time a particular ad is served; a record if that ad was "clicked" or if it was shown
                as a "conversion" event; what the ad offer is about; what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or
                video); which ad placement is involved (where the ad offer is displayed within the App); whether you
                respond to the ad.
            </p>

            <h2>Why we collect your information</h2>

                1) Develop, improve, and refine products, services, and functionality.<br>
                2) Communicate with you. For example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share

            <h2>Information security</h2>

            <p>
                The security of your personal information is highly important to us. We follow generally accepted
                industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
                once we receive it.<br>
                We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and
                unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in
                the processing and the nature of the personal information.<br>
                We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, which are designed to implement
                data-protection principles, such as data minimization, in an effective manner and to integrate the
                necessary safeguards into the processing. We seek your personal data to be encrypted with proper and
                strong encryption algorithms, including hashing where possible.<br>
                Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
                secure. We do our best to protect your personal data, nevertheless, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                security. In the event that your personal information is compromised as a breach of security, we will
                promptly notify you in compliance with applicable law.
